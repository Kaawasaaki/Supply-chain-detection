# Supply Chain Anomaly Detection


# Overview


This project implements an anomaly detection system for supply chain data. The goal is to classify abnormal behaviors or irregularities in supply chain operations, such as order delays, inventory discrepancies, and shipment issues, by using machine learning techniques. The system uses three different machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection: Local Outlier Factor (LOF),Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM.

# Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales and normalizes features.
- **Anomaly Detection Models**: Uses three different algorithms for anomaly detection:
  - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
  - **Isolation Forest**
  - **One-Class SVM**
